# cycling_through_the_rain
In this notebook I'm exploring the weather during my daily commute by bike from Haarlem to Hoofddorp-Zuid and how often it rains during my commuting time. In this notebook I use the KNMI data (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute or Dutch Met Office), extracted from the API. I will be leaving my house at 8 o'clock in the AM and returning on 5 o'clock in the PM.
